# NEWER AUTHENTICATION METHOD
With this authentication method, users have a special identity file containing a **private key**, which is *equivalent to a password*, and which they keep secret. Their account on the server is configured with a matching **public key**, which does not have to be secret. When logging in, *users can configure ssh to provide the private key* and if their matching public key is installed in that account on that remote server, it will log them in without asking for a password.

###### EXAMPLE
`-i` option is used to specify the users private key

`[user@host ~]$ ssh -i mylab.pem remoteuser@remotehost`
`[remoteuser@remotehost ~]$`

In the example `mylab.pem` is the private key of the user.
