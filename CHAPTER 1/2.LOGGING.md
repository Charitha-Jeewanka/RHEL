# LOGGING IN TO A LOCAL COMPUTER
Physical console supports multiple virtual consoles.
A user can interchange between them by using `ctrl + alt` and a FN key `f1` through `f6`
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, if the graphical environment is available, the login screen will run on the first virtual console, called `tty1`. 
*Five additional text login prompts are available on virtual consoles two through six.*

# LOGGING IN OVER THE NETWORK
In Linux, the most common way to get a shell prompt on a remote system is to use **Secure Shell (SSH)**. Most Linux systems (including Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and macOS provide the *OpenSSH* command-line program *ssh* for this purpose.

###### EXAMPLE
`[user@host ~]$ ssh remoteuser@remotehost`
`remoteuser@remotehost's password: password`
`[remoteuser@remotehost ~]$`
**ssh** command encrypts the password against hijacking or eavesdropping.
