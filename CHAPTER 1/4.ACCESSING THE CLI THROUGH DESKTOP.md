1. *Top bar:* The bar that runs along the top of the screen. It is displayed in the Activities overview and in workspaces. 
	- The top bar provides the Activities button, and controls for volume,networking, calendar access, and switching between keyboard input methods (if more than one is configured).
2. *Activities overview:* This is a special mode that helps a user organize windows and start applications.
3. *System menu:* The menu in the upper-right corner on the top bar provides control to adjust the brightness of the screen, and to switch on or off the network connections
4. *Dash:* This is a configurable list of icons of the user's favorite applications, applications which are currently running, and a **grid** button at the bottom of the dash which can be used to select arbitrary applications. 
	- Applications can be started by clicking on one of the icons or by using the grid button to find a less commonly used application. The dash is also sometimes called the **dock**.
5. *Windows overview:* An area in the center of the Activities overview which displays thumbnails of all windows active in the current workspace. This allows windows to be more easily brought to the foreground on a cluttered workspace, or to be moved to another workspace.
6. *Workspace selector:* An area to the right of the Activities overview which displays thumbnails of all active workspaces and allows workspaces to be selected and windows to be moved from one workspace to another.
7. *Message tray:* The message tray provides a way to review notifications sent by applications or system components to GNOME.
	- Opened by `super + M` (super means windows key)
	- Closed by `esc` or `super + M` again.
