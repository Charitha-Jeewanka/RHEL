# BASIC COMMAND SYNTAX
### MORE THAN ONE COMMAND
If you want to type more than one command on a single line, use the **semicolon (;)** as a command separator.

Semicolon acts under *metacharacters* for bash

##### cat
`cat file1 file2` ---> Gives the output of multiple files
`less file2` ---> Displays one page of a file at a time

##### head and tail
`head` and `tail` commands by default shows only **10** lines of the file.
`-n` option can be used to specify the number of lines.

##### wc
`wc` counts the number of lines in a file
`-l`,`-w`,`-c` option can  be used to count **lines,words,characters** respectively

###### EXAMPLE
`[user@host ~]$ wc /etc/passwd`
`45 102 2480 /etc/passwd`
`[user@host ~]$ wc -l /etc/passwd ; wc -l /etc/group`
`45 /etc/passwd`
`70 /etc/group`
`[user@host ~]$ wc -c /etc/group /etc/hosts`
`966 /etc/group`
`516 /etc/hosts`
`1482 total`

### CONTINUING A LONG COMMAND ON ANOTHER LINE
- To do this, you will use a `backslash character (\)`, referred to as the *escape character*
- By escaping the newline character, the shell is told to move to a new command line without performing command execution
- The shell acknowledges the request by displaying a **continuation prompt**, referred to as the *secondary prompt*, using the `greater-than character (>)` by default, on an empty new line.

### COMMAND HISTORY
- `history` command gives a list of used commands.
- The `!number` command expands to the command matching the number specified. 
- The `!string` command expands to the most recent command that begins with the string specified.
